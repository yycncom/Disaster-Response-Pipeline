# Disaster Response Pipeline Project
   Analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.
Creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that sending the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
This project including a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. 
The web app also displaying visualizations of the data. 
### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
