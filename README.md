# Disaster Response Pipeline Project
   Analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.
Creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that sending the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
This project including a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app also displaying visualizations of the data. 

### Instructions:

1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.


   - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
   - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

```   
1. ETL Pipeline
 
In a Python script, `process_data.py`, data cleaning pipeline :

   - Loads the messages and categories datasets
   - Merges the two datasets
   - Cleans the data
   - Stores it in a SQLite database(DisasterResponse.db)    
2. ML Pipeline
 
In a Python script, `train_classifier.py`, a machine learning pipeline that:

   - Loads data from the SQLite database
   - Splits the dataset into training and test sets
   - Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
   - Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
   - Outputs results on the test set
   - Exports the final model as a pickle file(classifier.pkl)    

3. Flask Web App

In a Python script,`run.py`,flask web app:

   - data visualizations using Plotly in the web app. 
   - classification results in several categories.
